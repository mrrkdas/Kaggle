Our goal is to make metrics that evaluate the o-line and d-line

Metrics off the top of my head:

    O-Line:
        * The time it takes for them to be within 1 yard of the quaterback (more is better) (CODE: 62DCNHKC)

    D-Line:
        * The it takes for them to be within 1 yard of the quaterback (CODE: SP3HVBA5)
        * The time it takes for the quaterback to scramble (CODE: VHBSCAB8)
        * What direction the opposite team moves on average during the game (CODE: KC6CJW43)
